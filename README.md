# Principal-Component-Analysis-Gene-Cancer-Markers
Datasets containing the initial (training, 38 samples) and independent (test, 34 samples) datasets used in the paper: Golub et al "Molecular Classification of Cancer: Class Discovery and Class Prediction by Gene Expression Monitoring"  These datasets contain measurements corresponding to ALL and AML samples from Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood. Intensity values have been re-scaled such that overall intensities for each chip are equivalent. The goal is to categorize the samples into AMP and ALL using Principal Component Analysis.
